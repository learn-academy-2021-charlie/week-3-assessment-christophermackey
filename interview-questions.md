# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: `this` is used to access informatin within a class. 

  Researched answer: `this` is  a javascript keyword that refers to the object it belongs to.  



2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: A) Yarn is a spun thread used for knitting, weaving, or sewing. In Javascript, yarn is part of the Jest testing framework. B) I'm not sure about this one.

  Researched answer: A) Yarn is a file manager for the Jest testing framework. B) This was hard to find but I believe the yarn.lock file is modified when we run yarn. This file holds the dependencies used for the project.



3. What are props in React?

  Your answer:Props are properties similar to parameters and allow data to be passed form parent components to child components.

  Researched answer: props, or properties, is a React keyword used to pass informamtion from one component to another. They can only be passed downstream to nested components. Props are basically a snapshot of state that can then be passed down to another component and manipulated by the user. 



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is syntax that is similar to HTML but used in React applications.

  Researched answer: JSX is a sytax extension of Javascript and a building block of React Components. Only one JSX element can be rendered in React, meaning all other elements need to be wrapped in a single JSX tag or React Fragment.



5. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:DOM events are changes that occur on the app based on user input.

  Researched answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model and it is always looking for changes. These types of changes can be from a user clicking their mouse, hovering over elements, or inputing data. These are DOM events. 



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:A function that has been declared but does not have a name assigned.

  Researched answer: An anonymouse function is a nameless function that cannot be called on after its initial creation. These are often used as arguments of other functions, or can be used to immediatly execute the function.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Used to control the output of data submitted to a form. It works similar to the way conditionals work in Javascript. 

2. Ruby:A backend, object-oriented programming language that is easy to read and write. It is general purpose, meaning it is designed to code software for a wide variety of domains. Ruby can be embedded directly into HTML.

3. Object oriented programming:OOP is a programming model that was designed to handle large, complex software systems. In order to maintain large amounts of data, OOP implements objects which are containers to house the data. This allows dependencies to be split into smaller parts, rather than relying on the entire program.

4. Ruby hash:A container of data that contains unique keys and their values. Much like an array, iterable methods can also be used on hash.

5. Ruby blocks:Anonymous functions that create blocks of code to be executed.
